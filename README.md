Today we're going to build web maps about parks! We've created three project levels to get you started on a project that matches your skill (or ambition!) level.

### Beginner: Mapping Missing SF Parks
Prereqs: None!

### Intermediate: Mapping Missing SF Parks & Adding Popups
Prereqs: Some familarity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### Advanced: Web App that Filters iNaturalist Data

We hope you have a lot of fun and learn a lot building these out! We're here to help if you get stuck!
